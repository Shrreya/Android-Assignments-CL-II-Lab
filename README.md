# Android-Assignments-CL-II-Lab

This repository contains Android application projects required to be completed as laboratory assignments in Computer Laboratory II of the B.E. course semester 7 at Cummins College of Engineering for Women.<br /><br />
These assignments have been performed on Android Studio (beta version 0.8.14)<br /><br />
The following two projects were used for basic demonstration of Android application development.<br /><br />
1. Hello World : A simple Android application that displays "Hello World!" on the mobile screen.<br /><br />
2. Form and Database : A two screen Android application used to accept data from user in a form, store the same on a SQLite database and display each data set in a listview. This project demonstrates the concepts of Activities, Intents, basic Android UI elements, data storage, Toasts and Adapters.<br /><br />
The assignments to be performed in the lab will be uploaded soon.
